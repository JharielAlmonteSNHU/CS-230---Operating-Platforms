# CS-230---Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  -The application is a multi-player, cross-platform, puzzle-solving game called "Draw It or Lose It" by The Gaming Room. Draw It or Lose It was inspired by the 1980s television game Win, Lose, or Draw, in which teams would compete to guess      what is being drawn. The Gaming Room, our client, wanted us to create a web-based game that serves multiple platforms including mobile devices. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  -While developing the Project Software Design document, I emphasized in formulating my ideas, findings and suggestions as detailed as possible, to provide valuable information, but most importantly, make it readable and easy to grasp. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  -The most valuable aspect or factor of the document as a whole is the detailed information about crucial development aspects of this project (Server, client, and development tools).
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -One aspect I consider that can be revised is the evaluation table for the development characteristics of each platform (Mac, Linux, Windows, mobile devices). I believe this information could be revised by a more experienced developer to 
   provide more accurate information.  
   
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -As developers, we must create software to ensure that user's experience is not compromised despite the implementation requirements, as this is a crucial factor to ensure the success of the application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  -Scalability and compatability, all of which will be based on the user's or costumer's requirements to ensure a positive user experience. In addition, conducting extensive research regarding the tools frameworks and practices based on the platforms relative to the software requirements.
